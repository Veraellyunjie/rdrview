# rdrview

Command line tool to extract the main content from a webpage, as done by the
"Reader View" feature of most modern browsers. It's intended to be used with
terminal RSS readers, to make the articles more readable on web browsers such
as lynx. The code is closely adapted from
[the Firefox version](https://github.com/mozilla/readability)
and the output is expected to be mostly equivalent.

## Security

This tool is young and written in C, so it's reasonable to wonder about the
potential for memory issues. To be safe, all HTML parsing happens inside a
sandboxed subprocess. Seccomp is used for this purpose on Linux, Pledge on
OpenBSD, and Capsicum on FreeBSD.

## Usage

### Linux

There are three direct dependencies: libxml2, libseccomp and libcurl.
On Debian/Ubuntu, you can install the first two by running (as root):

    apt install libxml2-dev libseccomp-dev

The libcurl package comes in different flavours, depending on the backend that
provides the SSL support. Any of them will do. To install the GnuTLS version:

    apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev

For _rdrview_ to be useful, you should also get a character mode web browser
such as lynx:

    apt install lynx

The name of the packages might differ in your distribution. On Fedora, for
example, you can install everything with:

    dnf install libcurl-devel libxml2-devel libseccomp-devel lynx

To build _rdrview_, just cd to its directory and run

    make

Now it should be ready to be used. You can try:

    ./rdrview 'https://github.com/eafer/rdrview'

For more information, see the man page:

    man ./rdrview.1

If you find _rdrview_ useful and want to install it, become root again and run

    make install

Now you can just call it with `rdrview` and get help with `man rdrview`, like
you would for any other tool in your system.

### BSDs

To build _rdrview_ on the BSDs, you will need GNU make as well as the libraries.
Having a terminal browser available is recommended. On OpenBSD, become root and
run

    pkg_add gmake gcc libxml curl lynx

On FreeBSD, that would be

    pkg install gmake gcc libxml2 curl lynx

Now you can cd to the source directory and run `gmake` for the build, and
optionally `gmake install` for the installation. The BSDs don't provide any
mailcap file by default, so to run rdrview you will need to specify the web
browser:

    ./rdrview -B lynx 'https://github.com/eafer/rdrview'

### macOS

I don't own any Apple computers to test this myself, but I've been told that
_rdrview_ does build on macOS. A sandbox is not yet implemented, but the tool
can still be run with the `--disable-sandbox` flag, as long as the user
understands the risk.

## Credits

_rdrview_ was written by
[Ernesto A. Fern√°ndez](mailto:ernesto.mnd.fernandez@gmail.com),
but it's mainly a transpilation done by hand of Mozilla's _Readability.js_;
which was itself, in their own words, "heavily based on Arc90's
readability.js". This is the original license:
